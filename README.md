## Overview

This repository contains one of the core theoretical components of the *Entropy Folding* research programme: a general scaling framework that treats **scale as a function of entropy, stability, and resolution**, rather than as a simple measure of size or magnitude.

Where traditional scaling laws focus on bulk quantities (power, mass, population, parameter counts), *Entropy Foundation — Scale* formalises **how systems change their behaviour across scales**: when local interactions cease to be predictive, when global structure emerges, and when phase transitions occur under rising entropy.

The paper defines:

- a working definition of **scale** in terms of resolution boundaries  
- the **Entropy Stretch** principle (how far a system can be pushed before collapse)  
- the **ECPD** (Entropic Cost Per Distinction) as a measure of scalable efficiency  
- phase transitions of scale (locality → projection → topology → trans-scale)  
- universal **scaling failure modes** (resolution drift, energetic starvation, entropic shear)

Unlike domain-specific models, this framework is **substrate-agnostic**: it applies equally to physical systems, cognitive architectures, AI colonies, institutions, and socio-technical networks.

This work is released as a free and open theoretical contribution to the scientific commons.
